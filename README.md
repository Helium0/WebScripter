What script does?
- counts products in general
- shows all available colours 
- each product has his special details: colour, price, discount if available, product tag, available sizes
- each product has hyperlink which provides to the main page, hyperlink for webphotos
- below product details adds product photos if available

In conclusion we can click on hyperlink to see product or scroll down to the next page to see product images

This is how "search" works on this webpage.
